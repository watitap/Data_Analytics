Based on my Tableau data analysis for the Titanic Survival Rate, here is a summary of your findings:

Age and Survival:
Survival rates were analyzed across different age groups with custom age bins every ten years.
The data suggests variable survival rates across age groups. Notably, the majority of survivors were within the age range of 11 to 40, which generally represents healthier and stronger individuals who may have had better chances of surviving the harsh conditions. Although younger passengers (aged 0-10) and the elderly (aged 70+) also had significant survival rates, this might indicate a prioritization of these age groups during rescue operations due to their vulnerability.

Gender and Survival:
A significant disparity in survival rates between genders was observed. Females had a much higher survival rate compared to males. This could be reflective of the "women and children first" policy reportedly used during lifeboat loading.

Class and Survival:
Passengers' class on the Titanic also influenced survival rates, with first-class passengers having the highest survival rate followed by second and then third class. This suggests socioeconomic status played a crucial role in survival chances.
The breakdown by class and gender further highlights this disparity, with first-class females having the highest survival rate at 96.81%, and third-class males the lowest at 13.54%.

Overall Survival Stats:
Out of the 891 recorded passengers, 342 survived while 549 did not. The overall survival rate of around 38% underscores the tragic nature of the disaster.
This analysis demonstrates how demographic factors like age, gender, and socio-economic status significantly influenced survival chances on the Titanic.
